    	<h2 style="color: black">KAS PATHAR / KAAS PLATEAU</h2>
    	<p ><font color="black">Popularly known as the Plateau of Flowers, Kaas Plateau is one of the famous tourist attractions in Maharashtra and also a popular picnic spot among nature lovers during late monsoons. The plateau is situated at an altitude of 1200 m and is approximately 1,000 hectares in area. The name 'Kaas' originates from the Kaasa tree.</font></p>

<p><font color="black">Kaas Plateau was formed by volcanic activities and is covered by a thin soil cover as a result of which, no vegetation thrives in the region. This area comes under very high rainfall zone. Due to this, the flora and fauna of the region is quite unique. These unique ecological features make Kaas one of the hotspots of biodiversity.</font></p>
<p><font color="black">Kaas Plateau overlooks the dense evergreen forests of the Koyna Wildlife Sanctuary and serves as the catchment area of the Koyna Dam. This is also a haven for bird watchers, as many species of birds can be spotted here. There is a wonderful lake called Kaas Lake, which is situated towards the south of the Plateau.

<h2 style="color: black">MAHABLESHWAR</h2>

<p><font color="black">This pretty hill station is often referred as the queen of hill stations in Maharashtra. It offers panoramic view of the plains with the imposing sloppy peaks and surrounding woods. Mahabaleshwar constitutes three villages - Malcolm Peth, Old Mahabaleshwar and some part of the Shindola village.</font></p>

<p><font color="black">Present day Mahabaleshwar has come in to existence in the year 1829-30, when it became the summer capital of Bombay presidency during the British Raj. Earlier, it was known as Malcolm Peth and the first historical mention of Mahabaleshwar dates back to 1215 CE when the King Singhan of Devgiri visited Old Mahabaleshwar. He built a small temple and water tank at the source of the river Krishna. In the 16th century, the Maratha family of Chandarao ruled over the city.</font></p>

<p><font color="black">Mahabaleshwar is the source of the Krishna River that flows across Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The legendary source of the river is a spout from the mouth of a statue of a cow in Panch Ganga Temple in Old Mahabaleshwar. Four other rivers also flow from here, before they merge into the Krishna; these are Koyana, Venna (Veni), Savitri and Gayatri.</font></p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>


<h2 style="color: black">AJINKYATARA FORT</h2>

<p><font color="black">Situated atop Ajinkyatara Mountain, at an altitude of 3,300 feet, Ajinkyatara Fort offers a panoramic view of Satara City. Ajinkyatara Fort was built by Raja Bhoj of the Shilhara dynasty. In 1673 CE, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj took control of this fort from Adil Sha and further Aurangajeb controlled this fort between 1700 CE and 1706 CE. In 1708 CE, Shahu Maharaj won Ajinkyatara, remained with the Marathas till the British conquered the fort in 1818 AD.</font></p>


<p><font color="black">The fort is also referred to as the 'Fort of the Sapta-Rishi' and can be observed from the hill of Yawateshwar, which is 5 km away from Satara. This fort is surrounded by 4 m high thick walls with bastions. There were two gates. The main gate, made formidable by high buttresses, is close to the north-west corner and the small gate in the south-east corner. There are number of water tanks inside the fort for storing water. Visitors can also visit the temples of Devi Mangalai, Lord Shankar and Lord Hanuman on the northeast side of the fort.</font></p>


<p><font color="black">The best time to visit the fort is from November to February. The trek of Ajinkyatara is of easy level and hence is recommended for beginner level trekkers. There is also a motorable road that takes visitors directly to the top of the fort.</font></p><br><br><br><br><br><br>


<h2 style="color: black">PANCHGANI</h2>

<p><font color="black">Situated at an altitude of 1334 m, Panchgani is bordered by Wai, Bavdhan and Nagewadi dam in the east, Gureghar in the west, Khingar and Rajpuri in the south and Dhom dam in the north. Panchgani is nestled at middle of five hills in the Sahyadri mountain ranges, also there are five villages around the Panchgani which are Dandeghar, Khingar, Godwali, Amral & Taighat.</font></p>
<p><font color="black">The town was discovered by the British as a summer resort in 1860s. Mahabaleshwar was the summer resort of choice for the British, but it was uninhabitable during the monsoons. Panchgani was developed as a retirement place for the British as it remained pleasant throughout the year. John Chesson, a British superintendent, was responsible for the transformation of Panchgani into a summer resort.</font></p>
<p><font color="black">Panchgani has several beautiful tourist attractions. Table Land, Parsi Point, Kamalgadh Fort, Devil's Kitchen, Rajpuri Caves, Sydney Point, Mapro Gardens, Dhom dam etc. are some of the major sightseeing options in Panchgani. Panchgani is dotted with British style old bungalows and Parsi houses. It is also known for many residential educational institutions and a favored destination for health resorts.

<h2 style="color: black">SANGAM MAHULI / KSHETRA MAHULI</h2>

<p><font color="black">Sangam Mahuli is one of the popular pilgrimage places to visit in Satara. The other side of the river Krishna is called Kshetra Mahuli. These villages earlier were part of Aundh Princely State. Kshetra Mahuli was the birth place of Ramshastri Prabhune, the famous spiritual and political adviser of the fourth Peshva Madhavrav (1761-1772 CE). Mahuli was the place of meeting between the last Peshva Bajirav (1796-1817 CE) and Sir John Malcolm just before the Anglo-Maratha war was declared.
</font></p>
<p><font color="black">There are 2 well known temples around the convergence of the rivers - Vishweshwar and Rameshwar. Sri Kashi Vishweshwar Temple is situated in Sangam Mahuli and is dedicated to Lord Shiva. The temple was built in 1735 CE by Shripatrao Pant Pratinidhi. This land was donated by Shahu Maharaj to Shripatrao Pant Pratinidhi, as a Brahman dakshina. Pant Pratinidhi donated the land to another Brahmin, Anant Bhat Galande.
